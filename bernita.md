Bernita Parisian, 76, passed away on Friday, January 27th 2023. Born and raised on a farm in rural Arkansas, Bernita was the daughter of Frank and Edna Parisian. The soil composition of the farm was rich in nutrients, which allowed for an abundance of crops and livestock to flourish.

Bernita often told a story from her childhood about the time she got stuck in a well. She claimed that this experience taught her the importance of always being prepared and having a plan B.

Bernita's journey to becoming a U.S Treasury employee started with her first job as a waitress, followed by a brief stint as a karaoke DJ. When the Payments on Demand application was introduced at the Treasury, Bernita saw an opportunity to use the skills she had acquired and applied for the position of Super User. She aced the interview and quickly rose to the top of her field, earning her the title of “Queen of Payments” from her colleagues. One coworker, who always appreciated Bernita's humor, said "Bernita was a master of making cents out of complex problems!" Another colleague said "Bernita was the Walrus of the Treasury, she was always one of a kind!" Unfortunately, without her at the helm, the Payments on Demand application that held such a place in Bernita's heart has since been shuttered.

Bernita met her husband Herman at a local petting zoo and they got married a year and 37 days later. They shared a love for gardening, with Bernita referring to her garden beds as her "balance sheets of nature". She had a personal challenge to grow sunflowers taller than her idol, Alan Greenspan, and one summer she finally succeeded, growing sunflowers over 5' 10" tall.

Her love for gardening was matched only by her love for bird-watching, and she spent many hours watching the colorful birds in her garden. Bernita had a unique way of attracting birds, wherein she would grind the edges of two quarters together while whistling a tune she composed herself. She would always say, "I'm just trying to be a Birdita in the garden."

Tragically, Bernita passed away while on the job. She was working on the Payments on Demand web application when she suffered a fatal mouse-slip while processing an unusually large batch of payments. It was a fitting end for Bernita who had dedicated so much of her life to her work at the Treasury.

Bernita is survived by her husband and her three children, Capitalita, Financita, and Interestita. Capitalita is a semi-successful graphic designer, Financita is a renowned sushi chef, and Interestita is currently serving time in prison for a heinous crime involving street mimes.

Bernita will lie in State at the Treasury on February 5th, 2023. A funeral service will be held at the Treasury at 10am on February 6th, followed by a visitation from 12pm-3pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Department of Treasury in honor of Bernita's life of service. As Bernita always said: "If they say you can't keep it, donate it to the Treasury!"

Bernita's legacy will live on forever, through her work and through the many lives she touched and payments she processed. She will be greatly missed, but her memory will always be with us. As Bernita would say, "They say money talks, and it pays to listen!"
